# QuoteBot
Hey there, welcome to the QuoteBot code repo! This is where the code that ran QuoteBot is stored after shutdown, if you want to know more about the shutdown, please [read this](https://gist.github.com/comhad/f7b6fe04b0733058f555c2e0fa75e8bd).

# Notes
If you used QuoteBot, you would have known there was a dashboard to upload sprites. That's not included in this code. It would have made an already complex system to impractical to release as source code. So instead, I've reimplemented a local database system I used for testing a while ago, see the help command for more info.

There's two different types of generators, the old generator refers to the generator ran by Demi, and the new generator refers to the one created by me. I can't entirely remember why I seperated them, but the new generator uses custom sprites, where the old generator just uses discord profile pictures and UNDERTALE/DELTARUNE sprites, use `help quote` for more info on these.

# TODO
- connect textbox generator properly
- deploy on clean interface
